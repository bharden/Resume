      <p>Experience is one of the greatest teachers. In my experience you can read a million books and study hundreds of hours, but you will stil be at a
        disadvantage to those who have even the smallest amount of experience. In order for people to trust me and allow me to help them in their buisnesses, I need to help people understand who I am and the experience I have.
        I have been doing programming for about a year now (I know it doesn't seem like that much). I the last year I have spent hundreds of hours in classes learning how to program in a variety of languages and areas of the computer science feild.
        Outside of work however, is probably where I have learned the most. I am lucky enough to have a job as junior developer. I work under an amazing supervisor who worked as a developer for Apple during the big Apple Boom! With him as my mentor
        my skills in programming have sky rocketed far beyond anything I had expected to have at this point. The work experience I posses is one of my biggest qualifiers for any job offer as a programmer of any kind. I hope this has helped you get to know me a little better. feel free to visit my about page for more  information.</p>
