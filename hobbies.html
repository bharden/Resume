        <p>I love to go on dates with my fiancé she is amazing. We enjoy going on fun excersions. She is from brazil so we have the added advantage that everything here the snow and the mountains and everything else
          is all new to her and it just makes our dates that much better.</p>

        <p>I love to paint and draw. I wouldn't really consider myself an artist, but I love to draw and paint when I have some spare time.
          It really helps me feel good and stay relaxed about life. If I get stuck on something in my programs it is not to uncommon to find me painting while I ponder a solution for the bug in my code.</p>
